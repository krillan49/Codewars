# Motivation
# When compressing sequences of symbols, it is useful to have many equal symbols follow each other, because then they can be encoded with a run length encoding. For example, RLE encoding of "aaaabbbbbbbbbbbcccccc" would give something like 4a 11b 6c.
#
# (Look here for learning more about the run-length-encoding.)
#
# Of course, RLE is interesting only if the string contains many identical consecutive characters. But what bout human readable text? Here comes the Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation.
#
# Transformation
# There even exists a transformation, which brings equal symbols closer together, it is called the Burrows-Wheeler-Transformation. The forward transformation works as follows: Let's say we have a sequence with length n, first write every shift of that string into a n x n matrix:
#
# Input: "bananabar"
#
# b a n a n a b a r
# r b a n a n a b a
# a r b a n a n a b
# b a r b a n a n a
# a b a r b a n a n
# n a b a r b a n a
# a n a b a r b a n
# n a n a b a r b a
# a n a n a b a r b
# Then we sort that matrix by its rows. The output of the transformation then is the last column and the row index in which the original string is in:
#
#                .-.
# a b a r b a n a n
# a n a b a r b a n
# a n a n a b a r b
# a r b a n a n a b
# b a n a n a b a r <- 4
# b a r b a n a n a
# n a b a r b a n a
# n a n a b a r b a
# r b a n a n a b a
#                '-'
#
# Output: ("nnbbraaaa", 4)
# Of course we want to restore the original input, therefore you get the following hints:
#
# The output contains the last matrix column.
# The first column can be acquired by sorting the last column.
# For every row of the table: Symbols in the first column follow on symbols in the last column, in the same way they do in the input string.
# You don't need to reconstruct the whole table to get the input back.
# Goal
# The goal of this Kata is to write both, the encode and decode functions. Together they should work as the identity function on lists. (Note: For the empty input, the row number is ignored.)

def encode(s)
  return [''] if s == ''
  arr = []
  s.size.times do |n|
    arr << s.chars.rotate(-n)
  end
  sortarr = arr.sort_by{|a| a.join}
  [sortarr.transpose[-1].join, sortarr.map(&:join).index(s)]
end

def decode(s, n)
  return '' if s == ''
  a0 = s.chars.map{|e| [e]}
  a = s.chars.map{|e| [e]}
  (s.size - 1).times do
    a = a0.zip(a.sort).map{|ar| ar[0] + ar[1]}
  end
  a.sort[n].join
end
