# The problem
# How many zeroes are at the end of the factorial of 10? 10! = 3628800, i.e. there are 2 zeroes. 16! (or 0x10!) in hexadecimal would be 0x130777758000, which has 3 zeroes.
#
# Scalability
# Unfortunately, machine integer numbers has not enough precision for larger values. Floating point numbers drop the tail we need. We can fall back to arbitrary-precision ones - built-ins or from a library, but calculating the full product isn't an efficient way to find just the tail of a factorial. Calculating 100'000! in compiled language takes around 10 seconds. 1'000'000! would be around 10 minutes, even using efficient Karatsuba algorithm
#
# Your task
# is to write a function, which will find the number of zeroes at the end of (number) factorial in arbitrary radix = base for larger numbers.
#
# base is an integer from 2 to 256
# number is an integer from 1 to 1'000'000
# Note Second argument: number is always declared, passed and displayed as a regular decimal number. If you see a test described as 42! in base 20 it's 42**10 not 42**20 = 82**10.

require 'prime'

def zeroes(base, n)
  base.prime_division.map do |k, p|
    x = Math.log(n, k).round(7).floor
    res = 0
    until x == 0
      res += n / k**x
      x -= 1
    end
    res / p
  end.min
end
