# The first positive integer, n, with its value 4nÂ² + 1, being divisible by 5 and 13 is 4. (condition 1)
#
# It can be demonstrated that we have infinite numbers that may satisfy the above condition.
#
# If we name ai, the different terms of the sequence of numbers with this property, we define S(n) as:

#
# We are interested in working with numbers of this sequence from 10 to 15 digits. Could you elaborate a solution for these results?
#
# You will be given an integer value m(always valid an positive) and you should output the closest value of the sequence to m.
#
# If the given value m is in the sequence, your solution should return the same value.
#
# In the case that there are two possible solutions: s1 and s2, (s1 < s2), because |m - s1| = |m - s2|, output the highest solution s2
#
# No hardcoded solutions are allowed.
#
# No misterious formulae are required, just good observation to discover hidden patterns.
#
# See the example tests to see output format and useful examples, edge cases are included.
#
# Features of the random tests 1000 <= m <= 5.2 e14
#
# Note Sierpinsky presented the numbers that satisfy condition (1)
