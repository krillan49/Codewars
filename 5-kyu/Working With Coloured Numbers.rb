#===============================================================================================================

# We have the numbers with different colours with the sequence: ['red', 'yellow', 'blue'].
#
# That sequence colours the numbers in the following way:
#
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 .....
#
# We have got the following recursive function:
#
# f(1) = 1
# f(n) = f(n - 1) + n
# Some terms of this sequence with their corresponding colour are:
#
# term   value   colour
# 1        1     "red"
# 2        3     "blue"
# 3        6     "blue"
# 4       10     "red"
# 5       15     "blue"
# 6       21     "blue"
# 7       28     "red"
# The three terms of the same colour "blue", higher than 3, are: [6, 15, 21]
#
# We need a function `same_col_seq(), that may receive three arguments:
#
# val, an integer number
# k, an integer number
# colour, the name of one of the three colours(red, yellow or blue), as a string.
# The function will output a sorted array with the smallest k terms, having the same marked colour, but higher than val.
#
# Let's see some examples:
#
# same_col_seq(3, 3, 'blue') == [6, 15, 21]
# same_col_seq(100, 4, 'red') == [136, 190, 253, 325]
# The function may output an empty list if it does not find terms of the sequence with the wanted colour in the range [val, 2* k * val]
#
# same_col_seq(250, 6, 'yellow') == []
# That means that the function did not find any "yellow" term in the range [250, 3000]
#
# Tests will be with the following features:
#
# Nmber of tests: 100
# 100 < val < 1000000
# 3 < k < 20

def same_col_seq(val, k, col)
  return [] if col == 'yellow'
  cc = ['blue', 'yellow', 'red']
  m = cc.index(col)
  res = []
  until res.size == k
    val += 1
    res << val if (1 + 8 * val)**0.5 % 1 == 0 && (val + m) % 3 == 0
  end
  res
