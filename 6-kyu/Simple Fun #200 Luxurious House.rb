#===============================================================================================================

# The capital of Berland has n multifloor buildings. The architect who built up the capital was very creative, so all houses in the city were built in one row.
#
# Let's enumerate all the houses from left to right, starting with 0. A house is considered to be luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in each house with larger number. In other words, a house is luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all houses, located to the right from it.
#
# The new architect is interested in n questions, the ith of them is the following: "how many floors should be added to the ith house to make it luxurious?" (For each i from 1 to n, inclusive). You need to help him cope with this task.
#
# Note that all these questions are independent from each other — the answer to the question for house i does not affect other answers (i.e., the floors to the houses are not actually added).
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer array houses
# Array of positive integers, representing the number of floors in each house.
#
# The ith element is the number of floors in the ith house.
#
# 1 ≤ houses.length ≤ 1000
#
# [output] an integer array
# An array has the same length as input array, the ith element represents the number of floors that should be added to the ith house to make it luxurious.
#
# Example
# For houses = [1,2,3,1,2], the output should be [3,2,0,2,0].
#
# For houses[0], 3 floors should be added,
# then its floors is strictly greater than all houses of right side.
#
# For houses[1], 2 floors should be added.
#
# For houses[2], no need to add floor
# because it's already the luxurious.
#
# For houses[3], 2 floors need to added
#
# For houses[4], no house on the right,
# so no need to add any floor.
