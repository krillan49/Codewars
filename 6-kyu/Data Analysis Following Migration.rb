# Story
# Your company migrated the last 20 years of it's very important data to a new platform, in multiple phases. However, something went wrong: some of the essential time-stamps were messed up! It looks like that some servers were set to use the dd/mm/yyyy date format, while others were using the mm/dd/yyyy format during the migration. Unfortunately, the original database got corrupted in the process and there are no backups available... Now it's up to you to assess the damage.
#
# Task
# You will receive a list of records as strings in the form of [start_date, end_date] given in the ISO yyyy-mm-dd format, and your task is to count how many of these records are:
#
# correct: there can be nothing wrong with the dates, the month/day cannot be mixed up, or it would not make a valid timestamp in any other way; e.g. ["2015-04-04", "2015-05-13"]
# recoverable: invalid in its current form, but the original timestamp can be recovered, because there is only one valid combination possible; e.g. ["2011-10-08", "2011-08-14"]
# uncertain: the original timestamp cannot be retrieved, because one or both dates are ambiguous and may generate multiple valid results, or can generate only invalid results; e.g. ["2002-02-07", "2002-12-10"]
# Note: the original records always defined a non-negative duration (i.e. start_date â‰¤ end_date)
#
# Return your findings in an array: [ correct_count, recoverable_count, uncertain_count ]
#
# Examples
# ["2015-04-04", "2015-05-13"]  -->  correct     # nothing (could be) wrong here
# ["2013-06-18", "2013-08-05"]  -->  correct     # end date is ambiguous, but this is
#                                                # the only possible valid version
# ["2001-02-07", "2001-03-01"]  -->  correct     # both dates are ambiguous, but this is
#                                                # the only possible valid version
# ["2011-10-08", "2011-08-14"]  -->  recoverable # start date is wrong, but can be corrected
#                                                # because there is only one valid version possible
# ["2009-08-21", "2009-04-12"]  -->  recoverable # end date is wrong, but can be corrected
#                                                # because there is only one valid version possible
# ["1996-01-24", "1996-03-09"]  -->  uncertain   # end date is ambiguous (could also be 1996-09-03)
# ["2000-10-09", "2000-11-20"]  -->  uncertain   # start date is ambiguous (could also be 2000-09-10)
# ["2002-02-07", "2002-12-10"]  -->  uncertain   # both dates are ambiguous, and there are
#                                                # multiple possible valid versions
