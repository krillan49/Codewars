# DevOps legacy roasting!
# Save the business from technological purgatory.
# Convert IT to DevOps, modernize application workloads, take it all to the Cloud…….
#
# You will receive a string of workloads represented by words….some legacy and some modern mixed in with complaints from the business….your job is to burn the legacy in a disco inferno and count the value of each roasting and the number of complaints resolved.
#
# Here is a list of all complaints which need to be resolved:
#
# complaints (in this format, case-insensitive) -> "slow!", "expensive!", "manual!", "down!", "hostage!", "security!"
# The value is based on real or perceived pain by the business and the expense of keeping it all running.
#
# Pull the values from the list below...
#
# 1970s Disco Fever Architecture………
# Sort of like a design from Saturday night Fever….

#
# Legacy is identified by the following keywords:
#
# 1000 points - COBOL of any kind whatsoever
#               keyword => "COBOL"
# 500 points  - non-object oriented architecture
#               keyword => "nonobject"
# 500 points  - monolithic architecture
#               keyword => "monolithic"
# 100 points  - fax system dependencies
#               keyword => "fax"
# 100 points  - modem dependencies
#               keyword => "modem"
# 50 points   - thick client dependencies
#               keyword => "thickclient"
# 50 points   - tape drive dependencies
#               keyword => "tape"
# 50 points   - floppy drive dependencies
#               keyword => "floppy"
# 50 points   - workloads with DevOps Anti-patterns
#               keyword => "oldschoolIT"
#
# The count is based on case-insensitive words!
#
# Return a string in the following format
#
# ->'Burn baby burn disco inferno 2400 points earned in this roasting and 2 complaints resolved!'
#
# If there are no complaints and no legacy from above return
#
# ->'These guys are already DevOps and in the Cloud and the business is happy!'
# If you have any doubt COBOL should be burned.. just look at this quote from Dijkstra.
#
# The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense. Edsger Dijkstra
