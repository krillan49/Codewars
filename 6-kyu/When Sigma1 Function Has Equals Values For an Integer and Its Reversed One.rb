# The function sigma 1, σ1 in mathematics, is known as the one that gives the sum of the divisors of an integer number.
#
# For example for the number 10,
#
# σ1(10) = 18 # because the divisors of 10 are: 1, 2, 5, 10
#
# σ1(10) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18
# You can see the graph of this important function up to 250:

#
# The number 528 and its reversed, 825 have equal value for the function σ1.
#
# σ1(528) = σ1(825)
#
# divisors of 528 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 24, 33, 44, 48, 66, 88, 132, 176, 264 and 528
#
# the sum of the divisors of 528 is 1488
#
# divisors of 825 are: 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 33, 55, 75, 165, 275 and 825
#
# the sum of the divisors of 825 is 1488
# In fact 528 is the smallest non palindromic integer that has this property.
#
# We need a function, equal_sigma1(), that may collect all the positive integers that fulfill the property described above.
#
# The function receives an upper limit, nMax, will output the total sum of these numbers and its reversed while are less or equal nMax.
#
# Let's see some cases:
#
# equal_sigma1(100) = 0 # There are no numbers.
#
# equal_sigma1(1000) = 1353 # 528 and its revesed 825 were found, 528 +  825 = 1353
#
# equal_sigma1(2000) = 4565 # There are four numbers_: 528 + 825 + 1561 + 1651 = 4565
#
# equal_sigma1(1600) = 2914 # Now we have three numbers: 528 + 825 + 1561 = 2914
#
# equal_sigma1(1561) = 2914
# The palindromic numbers (like 88, 808, 929), numbers that are equal to its reversed should be discarded.
#
# Happy coding!!
