# Alan's child can be annoying at times.
#
# When Alan comes home and tells his kid what he has accomplished today, his kid never believes him.
#
# Be that kid.
#
# Your function 'AlanAnnoyingKid' takes as input a sentence spoken by Alan (a string). The sentence contains the following structure:
#
# "Today I " + [action_verb] + [object] + "."
#
# (e.g.: "Today I played football.")
# Your function will return Alan's kid response, which is another sentence with the following structure:
#
# "I don't think you " + [action_performed_by_alan] + " today, I think you " + ["did" OR "didn't"] + [verb_of _action_in_present_tense] + [" it!" OR " at all!"]
#
# (e.g.:"I don't think you played football today, I think you didn't play at all!")
# Note the different structure depending on the presence of a negation in Alan's first sentence (e.g., whether Alan says "I dind't play football", or "I played football").
#
# ! Also note: Alan's kid is young and only uses simple, regular verbs that use a simple "ed" to make past tense. There are random test cases.
#
# Some more examples:
#
# input  = "Today I played football."
# output = "I don't think you played football today, I think you didn't play at all!"
#
# input  = "Today I didn't attempt to hardcode this Kata."
# output = "I don't think you didn't attempt to hardcode this Kata today, I think you did attempt it!"
#
# input  = "Today I didn't play football."
# output = "I don't think you didn't play football today, I think you did play it!"
#
# input  = "Today I cleaned the kitchen."
# output = "I don't think you cleaned the kitchen today, I think you didn't clean at all!"
