# You are given a regular array arr. Let's call a step the difference between two adjacent elements.
#
# Your task is to sum the elements which belong to the sequence of consecutive elements of length at least 3 (but as long as possible), such that the steps between the elements in this sequence are the same.
#
# Note that some elements belong to two sequences and have to be counted twice.
#
# Example
# For arr = [54, 70, 86, 1, -2, -5, 0, 5, 78, 145, 212, 15], the output should be 639.
#
# There are 4 sequences of equal steps in the given array:
# {54, 70, 86} => step +16
# {1, -2, -5} => step -3
# {-5, 0, 5} => step +5
# {78, 145, 212} => step +67
# So the answer is
# (54 + 70 + 86) +
# (1 - 2 - 5) +
# (-5 + 0 + 5) +
# (78 + 145 + 212) = 639.
# The last element 15 was not be counted.
# For arr = [7, 2, 3, 2, -2, 400, 802], the output should be 1200.
#
# There is only 1 sequence in arr:
# {-2, 400, 802} => step +402
# So the answer is: -2 + 400 + 802 = 1200
# For arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be 15.
#
# Note that we should only count {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as a whole, any other small subset such as {1, 2, 3},{2, 3, 4},{3, 4, 5} are belong to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] array.integer arr
# 3 â‰¤ arr.length â‰¤ 100
#
# [output] an integer
# The sum of sequences.
