#
# Your task is to convert a string representing the lines/spaces in a 12 digit barcode/UPC-A into a string of numbers 0-9.
#
# A black line represents a 1 and a space represents 0. The string you are returning is the decimal representation of those binary digits. NOTE: The digits 0-9 are not represented as bits the usual way, UPC has it's own tables which are preloaded as LEFT_HAND and RIGHT_HAND dictionaries.
#
# The LEFT_HAND and RIGHT_HAND dictionaries contain 7 digit bit strings as keys and an integer for values. For example:
#
# '0011001' = 1 in LEFT_HAND
#
# '1100110' = 1 in RIGHT_HAND, left and right side bit strings are complements of each other.
#
# The structure of a UPC-A is as follows:
#
# Starts with a guard pattern, always representing 101. Known as left-hand guard pattern.
# 6 groups of 7 bits each, eg: '  ▍▍  ▍' = '0011001' = 1(left-hand). The first group is the number system digit.
# A center guard pattern, always representing 01010. Divides "left-hand" groups and "right-hand" groups.
# 6 groups of 7 bits each, eg: '▍▍  ▍▍ ' = '1100110' = 1(right-hand). The last group is the modulo check digit.
# Ends with a guard pattern, always representing 101. Known as right-hand guard pattern.
# The format for your returned string is:
#
# '(number_system) (left_hand) (right_hand) (modulo_check)'
# Example barcode, sorry about number formatting:
#
# 1. '▍ ▍   ▍▍ ▍ ▍▍   ▍  ▍▍  ▍   ▍▍ ▍   ▍▍ ▍   ▍▍ ▍ ▍ ▍ ▍▍▍  ▍ ▍▍  ▍▍ ▍▍ ▍▍  ▍  ▍▍▍ ▍▍  ▍▍ ▍   ▍  ▍ ▍'
# 2. '(101)0001101,0110001,0011001,0001101,0001101,0001101(01010)1110010,1100110,1101100,1001110,1100110,1000100(101)'
# 3. (left_guard)0,5,1,0,0,0(center_guard)0,1,2,5,1,7(right_guard)
# return '0 51000 01251 7'
# For this kata there will be no tricks, no error checking, or reading backwards. Inputs will always be correct, left to right, and a single bar/space will always represent 1/0. The validity of modulo check digit is irrelevant here, we're just doing conversion and formatting. Guards are not part of the returned string but will be part of the input.

# A bar in case you need to use it: ▍

def read_barcode(barcode)
  barcode = barcode.tr('▍ ', '10')
  left = barcode[3..44].chars.each_slice(7).map(&:join).map{|e| LEFT_HAND[e]}
  right = barcode[50..-4].chars.each_slice(7).map(&:join).map{|e| RIGHT_HAND[e]}
  res = (left + right).join
  res[0] + ' ' + res[1..5] + ' ' + res[6..10] + ' ' + res[11]
end
