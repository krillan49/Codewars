#===============================================================================================================

# We have a robot that was programmed to take only four directions: up, ('U'), down ('D'), right ('R'), left ('L').
#
# It takes one direction at a time randomly and for each direction that takes, it moves a distance equal to 'length_step'. The field where the robot "walks" has no border lines or limits.
#
# You can see the movement of the robot from a starting point (0, 0) and doing 100 steps. (click "Run"): (Go to https://trinket.io/python/af9037fb12 if you don't see the animation)
#
# We want to calculate the final distance from an initial position.
#
# For that we have to make the function  finaldist_crazyrobot() that receives:
#
# a list of tuples(python)(or an array of arrays javascript, ruby), moves. Each tuple (array ,js and ruby) having a direction and the length of the step.
#
# the initial position, init_pos, that are the coordinates (x0, y0) of the point where the robot is standing before it starts moving.
#
# Let's see an example in Python
#
# init_pos = (0, 0)
# moves = [('R', 2), ('U', 3), ('L', 1), ('D', 6)]
# finaldist_crazyrobot(moves, init_pos) == 3.16227766017
# In javascript:
#
# init_pos = [0, 0]
# moves = [['R', 2], ['U', 3], ['L', 1], ['D', 6]]
# finalDistCrazyRobot(moves, init_pos) == 3.16227766017
# In ruby:
#
# init_pos = [0, 0]
# moves = [['R', 2], ['U', 3], ['L', 1], ['D', 6]]
# finaldist_crazyrobot(moves, init_pos) == 3.16227766017
# We read the moves of the above example as it follows:
#
# The robot moves to the right a step two units long.
# Then, it goes up a step three units long.
# After, it moves to the left one unit length.
# And finally, it goes down six units of length.
# The final point where the robot stops has coordinates (1, -3).
#
# So, the distance between (0, 0) and (1, -3) is 3.16227766017
#
# Of course that the initial position may be different from [0, 0]. Let's see a case in Python:
#
# init_pos = (20, 18)
# moves = [('R', 32), ('D', 16), ('U', 31), ('L', 26), ('D', 14),('U', 4), ('R', 5), ('L', 16)]
# finaldist_crazyrobot(moves, init_pos) == 7.07106781187
# # distance from (20, 18) to (15, 23)
# In javacript:
#
# init_pos = [20, 18]
# moves = [['R', 32], ['D', 16], ['U', 31], ['L', 26], ['D', 14],['U', 4], ['R', 5], ['L', 16]]
# finalDistCrazyRobot(moves, init_pos) == 7.07106781187
# In ruby:
#
# init_pos = [20, 18]
# moves = [['R', 32], ['D', 16], ['U', 31], ['L', 26], ['D', 14],['U', 4], ['R', 5], ['L', 16]]
# finaldist_crazyrobot(moves, init_pos) == 7.07106781187
# # distance from [20, 18] to [15, 23]
# You do not have to round your result, the tests will do it for you.
#
# Your results will be compared to expected ones in terms of relative error.
#
# For this problem, our distances will be always positive.
#
# Our list, moves may be up to a thousand long.
#
# The units may be feet or meters. Our robot was programmed to "read" both English and International System.
