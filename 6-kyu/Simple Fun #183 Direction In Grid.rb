#===============================================================================================================

# You're standing at the top left corner of an n Ã— m grid and facing towards the right.
#
# Then you start walking one square at a time in the direction you are facing.
#
# If you reach the border of the grid or if the next square you are about to visit has already been visited, you turn right.
#
# You stop when all the squares in the grid are visited. What direction will you be facing when you stop?
#
# You can see the example of your long walk in the image below. The numbers denote the order in which you visit the cells.

#
# Given two integers n and m, denoting the number of rows and columns respectively, find out the direction you will be facing at the end.
#
# Output "L" for left, "R" for right, "U" for up, and "D" for down.
#
# Example:
# For n = 3, m = 3, the output should be "R".
#
# This example refers to the picture given in the description. At the end of your walk you will be standing in the middle of the grid facing right.
#
# Input/Output
# [input] integer n
# number of rows.
#
# 1 <= n <= 1000
#
# [input] integer m
# number of columns.
#
# 1 <= m <= 1000
#
# [output] a string
# The final direction.

def direction_in_grid(n,m)
  cels = n * m - m
  return 'R' if cels == 0
  ['D','L','U','R'].cycle.with_index do |s, i|
    if i.even?
      n -= 1
      cels -= n
    else
      m -= 1
      cels -= m
    end
    return s if cels == 0
  end
end
