#===============================================================================================================

# You have a Petri dish with bacteria, and you are preparing to dive into the harsh micro-world. But, unfortunately, you don't have any microscope nearby, so you can't watch them.
#
# You know that you have n bacteria in the Petri dish and size of the i-th bacteria is bacteriai. Also you know intergalactic positive integer constant K.
#
# The i-th bacteria can swallow the j-th bacteria if and only if bacteriai > bacteriaj and bacteriai ≤ bacteriaj + K. The j-th bacteria disappear, but the i-th bacteria doesn't change its size.
#
# Since you don't have a microscope, you can only guess the minimal possible number of bacteria that will remain in your Petri dish when you finally find a microscope.
#
# micro_world([101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54], 1) == 3
# micro_world([20, 15, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5) == 1
# Explanation
# bacteria = [101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54]
# K = 1
# The one of possible sequences of swallows is: [101,53,42,102,101,55,54] → [101,53,42,102,55,54] → [101,42,102,55,54] → [42,102,55,54] → [42,102,55]. In total there are 3 bacteria remaining.

def micro_world(bacteria, k)
  bacteria.reject{|e| bacteria.any?{|d| d > e && d <= e + k}}.size
end
