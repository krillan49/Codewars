# The sports centre needs repair. Vandals have been kicking balls so hard into the roof that some of the tiles have started sticking up. The roof is represented by r.
#
# As a quick fix, the committee have decided to place another old roof over the top, if they can find one that fits. This is your job.
#
# A 'new' roof (f) will fit if it currently has a hole in it at the location where the old roof has a tile sticking up.
#
# Sticking up tiles are represented by either '\' or '/'. Holes in the 'new' roof are represented by spaces (' '). Any other character can not go over a sticking up tile.
#
# Return true if the new roof fits, false if it does not.
