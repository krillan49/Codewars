#===============================================================================================================

# We have a set of consecutive numbers from 1 to n. We want to count all the subsets that do not contain consecutive numbers. E.g.
#
# If our set S1 is equal to [1,2,3,4,5] The subsets that fulfill these property are:
#
# [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,5],[1,3,5]
# A total of 12     subsets.
#
# From the set S2 equals to[1,2,3], it is obvious that we have only 4 subsets and are:
#
# [1],[2],[3],[1,3]
# Make a code that may give the amount of all these subsets for any integer n >= 2    .
#
# Features of the random tests:
#
# number of tests = 100
# 10 <= n <= 120

FIB = [0, 1]

def f(n)
  FIB << FIB.last(2).sum until FIB.size > n
  FIB[0..n].sum
